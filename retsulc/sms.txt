A quick question, can we use MatchGroupdId as ground truth for learning embeddings?

Also, can we use post-processing balancing technique (balancing the Amount to sum to zero) after clustering? Or do we need to solve this solely based on embeddings + clustering without any post-processing.

(I am seeing slightly better results with post-processing balancing technique after clustering
